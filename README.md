# Pico-projects
Collection of Raspberry Pi Pico project files either created or modified by me.  Unless otherwise stated, most of these are written in Arduino IDE, and are compiled/installed via [Arduino-Pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) (See documentation [here](https://arduino-pico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).  Most of this is for performance reasons, as I've noted 5-10x speed enhancements for compiled code (C) vs equivalent interpreted code (Circuit/Micro Python).
